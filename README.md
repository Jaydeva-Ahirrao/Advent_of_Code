Solving Puzzle


Hi,

Guess what? I stumbled upon these cool puzzles recently, thanks to a tip from a colleague. Decided to dive into solving them using Python, and it turned out to be a blast! The challenges were both fun and kind of tricky.
If you're up for a bit of coding adventure, you should totally check out Advent of Code. Or, if you're feeling lazy, just hit up this link: https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1 for the specific puzzle I tackled on day 1.

Enjoy the challenge!
